# Rohh ATS [ʌθš]
## Artificial Trading System aka Arthificial Task Sourcing or Artifize The System
### Arths v1.0.2 unconditionally not functional
Rohh ARTHS [ʌːrθs] original library continuation for trend-line-arths used to normalize numeric sequence. Do not know what I am doing, may be the something

There are totally nothing special, just some horizontal biases or medians or between min and max fences, just want to meet people, optimize work and make better results further on in my work.

no instruction required anyway it is not working 

Do not know when I will get back to this good looking demo, but it still not working so - total trash. It is interesting that I presume that I can do to make nor predict nor rate, but it will take a lot more time to accomplish. I am happy for these experience through life, please give me a chance I can do better alive nor UNDEFINED.

My lasting words for this git paste - be whatever you want to be
